                <p><strong>Type:</strong> poison</p>
                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong><i><p><strong>Stench:</strong> This Pokémon's damaging moves have a 10% chance to make the target flinch with each hit if they do not already cause flinching as a secondary effect.

This ability does not stack with a held item.

Overworld: The wild encounter rate is halved while this Pokémon is first in the party.</p><p><strong>Sticky-hold:</strong> This Pokémon's hold item cannot be removed by other Pokémon.

Damaging moves that would remove this Pokémon's item can still inflict damage against this Pokémon, e.g. knock off or pluck.  This Pokémon can still use moves that involve the loss of its own item, e.g. fling or trick.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the encounter rate while fishing is increased.</p><p><strong>Poison-touch:</strong> This Pokémon's contact moves have a 30% chance of poisoning the target with each hit.

This counts as an extra effect for the purposes of shield dust.  This ability takes effect before mummy.</p></i></p>
