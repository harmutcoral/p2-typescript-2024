                <p><strong>Type:</strong> poison</p>
                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong><i><p><strong>Intimidate:</strong> When this Pokémon enters battle, the opponent's Attack is lowered by one stage.  In a double battle, both opponents are affected.

This ability also takes effect when acquired during a battle, but will not take effect again if lost and reobtained without leaving battle.

This ability has no effect on an opponent that has a substitute.

Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.</p><p><strong>Shed-skin:</strong> After each turn, this Pokémon has a 33% of being cured of any major status ailment.</p><p><strong>Unnerve:</strong> Opposing Pokémon cannot eat held Berries while this Pokémon is in battle.

Affected Pokémon can still use bug bite or pluck to eat a target's Berry.</p></i></p>
