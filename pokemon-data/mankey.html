                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong><i><p><strong>vital-spirit:</strong> This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

This causes rest to fail altogether.  If a Pokémon is asleep and acquires this ability, it will immediately wake up; this includes when regaining a lost ability upon leaving battle.

This ability functions identically to insomnia in battle.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.</p><p><strong>anger-point:</strong> Whenever this Pokémon receives a critical hit, its Attack rises to the maximum of 6 stages.

This ability will still take effect if the critical hit is received by a substitute.</p><p><strong>defiant:</strong> When any of this Pokémon's stats are lowered, its Attack rises by two stages.

If multiple stats are lowered at once, this ability takes effect with each stat lowered.</p></i></p>
