                <p><strong>Type:</strong> normal, flying</p>
                <p><strong>keen-eye:</strong> This Pokémon cannot have its accuracy lowered.

This ability does not prevent any accuracy losses other than stat modifiers, such as the accuracy cut from fog; nor does it prevent other Pokémon's evasion from making this Pokémon's moves less accurate.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative accuracy modifiers through heart swap.

Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.</p><p><strong>sniper:</strong> This Pokémon inflicts triple damage with critical hits, rather than the usual double damage.</p> <!-- Include abilities with effects here -->
