                <p><strong>Type:</strong> rock, ground</p>
                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong><i><p><strong>rock-head:</strong> This Pokémon does not receive recoil damage from its recoil moves.

struggle's recoil is unaffected.  This ability does not prevent crash damage from missing with jump kick or high jump kick.</p><p><strong>sturdy:</strong> When this Pokémon is at full HP, any hit that would knock it out will instead leave it with 1 HP.  Regardless of its current HP, it is also immune to the one-hit KO moves: fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold.

If this Pokémon is holding a focus sash, this ability takes precedence and the item will not be consumed.</p><p><strong>sand-veil:</strong> During a sandstorm, this Pokémon has 1.25× its evasion, and it does not take sandstorm damage regardless of type.

The evasion bonus does not count as a stat modifier.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, the wild encounter rate is halved in a sandstorm.</p></i></p>
