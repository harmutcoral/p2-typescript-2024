                <p><strong>Type:</strong> poison, ground</p>
                <p><strong>poison-point:</strong> Whenever a move makes contact with this Pokémon, the move's user has a 30% chance of being poisoned.</p><p><strong>rivalry:</strong> This Pokémon inflicts 1.25× as much regular damage against Pokémon of the same gender and 0.75× as much regular damage against Pokémon of the opposite gender.

If either Pokémon is genderless, damage is unaffected.</p><p><strong>sheer-force:</strong> This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.

An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.

Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.</p> <!-- Include abilities with effects here -->
