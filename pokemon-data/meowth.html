                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong><i><p><strong>pickup:</strong> At the end of each turn, if another Pokémon consumed or Flung a held item that turn, this Pokémon picks up the item if it is not already holding one.  After each battle, this Pokémon has a 10% chance of picking up an item if it is not already holding one.

The air balloon and eject button cannot be picked up.

The items that may be found vary by game, and, since Pokémon Emerald, by the Pokémon's level.  This ability is checked after the battle ends, at which point any temporary ability changes have worn off.</p><p><strong>technician:</strong> This Pokémon's moves have 1.5× their power if their base power is 60 or less.

This includes moves of variable power, such as hidden power and magnitude, when their power is 60 or less.  helping hand's power boost is taken into account for any move, as is defense curl's power boost for rollout.</p><p><strong>unnerve:</strong> Opposing Pokémon cannot eat held Berries while this Pokémon is in battle.

Affected Pokémon can still use bug bite or pluck to eat a target's Berry.</p></i></p>
