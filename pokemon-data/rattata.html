                <p><strong>Type:</strong> normal</p>
                <p><strong>run-away:</strong> This Pokémon is always successful fleeing from wild battles, even if trapped by a move or ability.</p><p><strong>guts:</strong> Whenever this Pokémon is asleep, burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, it has 1.5× its Attack.  This Pokémon is not affected by the usual Attack cut from a burn.

This bonus does not count as a stat modifier.</p><p><strong>hustle:</strong> This Pokémon's physical moves do 1.5× as much regular damage, but have 0.8× their usual accuracy.

Special moves are unaffected.  Moves that do set damage, such as seismic toss, have their accuracy affected, but not their damage.

Overworld: If the lead Pokémon has this ability, higher-levelled Pokémon have their encounter rate increased.</p> <!-- Include abilities with effects here -->
