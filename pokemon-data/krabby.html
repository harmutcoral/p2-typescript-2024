                <p><strong>Type:</strong> water</p>
                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong><i><p><strong>hyper-cutter:</strong> This Pokémon's Attack cannot be lowered by other Pokémon.

This ability does not prevent any Attack losses other than stat modifiers, such as the Attack cut from a burn.  This Pokémon can still be passed negative Attack modifiers through heart swap or power swap.</p><p><strong>shell-armor:</strong> Moves cannot score critical hits against this Pokémon.

This ability functions identically to battle armor.</p><p><strong>sheer-force:</strong> This Pokémon's moves with extra effects have 1.3× their power, but lose their extra effects.

An effect chance is a move's chance to inflict a status ailment, cause a stat change, or make the target flinch in addition to the move's main effect. For example, thunder shock's paralysis is an extra effect, but thunder wave's is not, nor are knock off's item removal and air cutter's increased critical hit rate.

Moves that lower the user's stats are unaffected.</p></i></p>
