                <p><strong>Type:</strong> fire</p>
                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong><i><p><strong>Intimidate:</strong> When this Pokémon enters battle, the opponent's Attack is lowered by one stage.  In a double battle, both opponents are affected.

This ability also takes effect when acquired during a battle, but will not take effect again if lost and reobtained without leaving battle.

This ability has no effect on an opponent that has a substitute.

Overworld: If the first Pokémon in the party has this ability, any random encounter with a Pokémon five or more levels lower than it has a 50% chance of being skipped.</p><p><strong>Flash-fire:</strong> This Pokémon is immune to fire-type moves.  Once this Pokémon has been hit by a Fire move, its own Fire moves will inflict 1.5× as much damage until it leaves battle.

This ability has no effect while the Pokémon is frozen.  The Fire damage bonus is retained even if the Pokémon is frozen and thawed or the ability is lost or disabled.  Fire moves will ignore this Pokémon's substitute.  This ability takes effect even on non-damaging moves, i.e. will o wisp.</p><p><strong>Justified:</strong> Whenever a dark-type move hits this Pokémon, its Attack rises one stage.

The move is not negated in any way.</p></i></p>
