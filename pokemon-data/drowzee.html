                <p><strong>Abilities:</strong><i><p><strong>Insomnia:</strong> This Pokémon cannot be asleep.

This ability functions identically to vital spirit in battle.</p><p><strong>Forewarn:</strong> When this Pokémon enters battle, it reveals the move with the highest base power known by any opposing Pokémon to all participating trainers.

In the event of a tie, one is chosen at random.

Power | Moves
----: | -----
  160 | One-hit KO moves: fissure, guillotine, horn drill, and sheer cold
